# h1 Writing a Function in JavaScript

In JavaScript, functions are blocks of reusable code. They allow you to bundle functionality, make it more readable, and avoid repetition. Here's a brief tutorial on writing an arrow function in JavaScript.

 ## h2 1. Basic syntax

const functionName = (params) => {
  // code to be executed
}

 1. ***const:*** const should be used whenever a function expression is assigned to a variable.
2. ***The function name:*** The name you choose for the function.
***Parameters:*** Optional comma separated parameters. This is the data passed into the function. If there are no parameters, the () is still required.
3. ***The arrow syntax:*** Indicates that this will be a function.
4. ***The body:*** The statements that make up the function itself. Surrounded by curly braces.

Example:
```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

Tip: Functions often perform actions, so naming with a verb can make it clear what the function does. Examples include fetchData( ), calculateArea( ), or printReport( ). 

## h2 2. Calling a function

To execute the function, you call or invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses.

Example:
```javascript
greet('Alice'); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```
 ## h2 3. Return values

Functions can process data input and output a value using the return keyword.

Example: 
```javascript
const addNums = (numA, numB) => {
  return numA + numB
}

const total = addNums(2, 4);

console.log(total) // Expected value: 6
```

# Step 2: My Own guide on How to build perfect Sandiwch! 



## Step 1

1. Begin by spreading your ***condiments*** on the bottom slice of bread.
  * This can by any __sauce or dressing__ of your like, I usually prefer Miracle Whip and Dejon or Spicy mustard as base.

2. Layer the densest vegetables, such as __pickles__, followed by __lettuce__ and __tomato__
  * This can also vary from cheese to veg I prefer lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and cheese as te base.

3. Add the __cheese__ and Place the __meat__.
  * If u are __vegan__ or __vegetarian__ please replace __meat__ with other substitutable replacements i.e. beyond meat etc.
 
4. Finish by spreading another layer of __condiments_ on the top slice of __bread__.
  * Sometimes if u ike many __condiments__ on the sandwich u can layer those as well on thhe other slice of __bread__ for more flavor.
